# NoteApp üìù

**NoteApp** is a simple note-taking application built to help you store and manage your thoughts. It allows you to easily **create, view, update, and delete** your notes. It‚Äôs a small but efficient tool, perfect for basic note management.

## üöÄ How it Works

The application uses a basic **CRUD** system, making it easy to manage your notes with just a few clicks:

- **Create**: Add new notes by filling in a title and content.
- **Read**: Browse through your notes to see their content.
- **Update**: Modify any note when necessary.
- **Delete**: Remove notes from the list when they are no longer needed.

All of this is backed by an **SQLite** database, which stores your notes safely and securely.

## üõ†Ô∏è How to Use It

### 1. **Clone the Repository**
Start by cloning the repository to your local machine:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/FatalistikRake/LocalCRUD.git
cd NoteApp
```

### 2. **Open in Visual Studio**
Open **Visual Studio** and choose "Open Project" to open the **NoteApp** folder.

### 3. **Run the Application**
Once the project is loaded, press **F5** or click **"Start"** to run the app. The SQLite database will be created automatically if it doesn't exist.

### 4. **Using the App**
Once the app is running, you can:
- **Create** new notes by clicking the "Add Note" button.
- **Read** your notes in the list.
- **Update** them by selecting and editing an existing note.
- **Delete** notes when they are no longer needed.

## üîß Technologies Used

- **C#**: The programming language used for the app.
- **SQLite**: A lightweight database for storing the notes.
- **Visual Studio**: The development environment used to build the application.
- **XAML**: Used for designing the user interface.

## üö® Warnings

- **Compatibility**: Ensure you have the required version of **Visual Studio** and **.NET** for the application to work properly.
- **Data Backup**: While the app uses SQLite for storing notes, it‚Äôs always a good idea to back up important data manually.
